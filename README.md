# WhatsApp Talk to Unsaved Contacts
You don't have to leave the WhatsWeb interface to talk to unsaved contacts anymore!

### After
![After](media/after.jpg)


## Install
[Userscript][1] - [Firefox][2] - [Chrome][3].


## Usage
Press the phone button, input the phone number and hit ENTER. This will reload the current page, opening a chat window to the unsaved phone number.


## Why
<!-- Focus on explaining what the item does and why users should install it -->
I use mainly WhatsApp on my notebook. This allows me to quickly message many services to requests budgets, or to check wether they provide what I need.

It does the same thing online link generators like [create.wa](https://create.wa.link/) do, but without leaving the WhatsApp web interface. It calls WhatsApp API to contact an unlisted phone number.
